##### EXECUTION
configfile: "/data3/projects/xanthopore/seb/xanthopore-scripts/GTIPP_ONT_2020_assemblies/scripts/bdm_profile_r94_20220212/workflow_parameters.yaml" # REQUIRED, regardless baseDmux is run in local or HPC mode. Path to the config file for the tools
cores: 32    # OPTIONAL, maximum value for the total number of cores used in parallel (local or HPC). "all" to use all available cores
keep-going: true    # OPTIONAL, keep going on independent jobs even if a job fails
rerun-incomplete: true    # OPTIONAL, whether to re-run incomplete jobs or not
forceall: false   # OPTIONAL, whether to rerun the whole workflow or not

jobs: 20 # OPTIONAL, number of jobs to run in parallel. "all" to run all possible parallel jobs at the same time. This is mostly relevant in a HPC context if you want to limit the total number of concurrent jobs handleled by the scheduler.
max-jobs-per-second: 1 # OPTIONAL
max-status-checks-per-second: 10 # OPTIONAL
local-cores: 1 # OPTIONAL, Number of cores allocated to the snakemake process controlling the baseDmux wrokflow. If run as a job in scheduler system on HPC, this should ideally be inferior or equal to the number of cores allocated to the baseDmux master job.


##############################
##### Job Scheduler submission
##### See https://github.com/snakemake-profiles/doc
jobscript: "slurm-jobscript.sh" # REQUIRED for job submission with a HPC job scheduler only.
cluster: "slurm-submit.py" # REQUIRED for job submission with a HPC job scheduler only.
cluster-status: "slurm-status.py" # REQUIRED for job submission with a HPC job scheduler only.
immediate-submit: false # OPTIONAL for job submission with a HPC job scheduler only.


##############################
##### OUTPUT
reason: true   # whether to print the reason for each executed rule or not
printshellcmds: true    # whether to print out the shell commands that will be executed or not
verbose: true   # whether to print debugging output or not


##############################
##### BEHAVIOR
nolock: true    # whether to lock working directory or not
restart-times: 1    # number of times to restart failed jobs
show-failed-logs: false   # whether to display logs for failed jobs in the console
latency-wait: 60    # number of seconds to wait for the output file after the job finished
